## MOOSE Improvements

### General axisymmetric coordinates

The `RZ` coordinate system was extended to enable using general coordinate axes.
Before this, the `RZ` coordinate system was limited in the following ways:

- The origin of the coordinate system was restricted to be $(0,0,0)$ only.
- The direction of the axisymmetric axis was restricted to be the $\hat{x}$ or $\hat{y}$ direction.
- Only a single axisymmetric coordinate system could be defined.

Now arbitrary axisymmetric coordinate systems may be specified on a
per-subdomain basis: for each subdomain using `RZ`, the axis origin and
direction are specified. See [Mesh/index.md#coordinate_systems] for more
information.
